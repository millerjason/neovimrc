## ‚öôÔ∏è  My Neovim Configuration

This is my personal neovim configuration and it's unlikely to be perfect
for your use case.

What is in it?

* *Kickstart*: based configuration
* *Neovimacs*: modeless editing support, with common Emacs bindings in insert mode
* *Esc*: to toggle between insert (emacs bindings) and normal (neovim mode)
* *Tabs*: Prev (F1), Next (F2), New (F3), and Close (F4) to jump around
* *Movement*: Arrows and Tabs (and, yes, I know)
* *Batteries*: Python LSP, completion, treesitter

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
cd ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:millerjason/neovimrc.git
ln -s neovimrc nvim
```
